This milestone we modified the way pd file are recorded so they could be stored locally on the Android device properly. We added GPS and accelerometer functionality. SoundCloud (our planned web service) never repsonded with API access and none of the other option for audio upload sounded very interesting so we decided to scratch all of our work on that and create our own web service. So now our app can upload sound files created to our own web server (a web server I use for all of my private stuff) and then all uploaded sounds can be listened to at http://www.austinpetrie.com/enviromod/ which uses an HTML 5 web player library.
