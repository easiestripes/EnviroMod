<h3>How To Use Enviromod</h3>
<p>
This application allows the user to generate tones using amplitude and frequency modulation with accelerometer data. Using location services, the tone color of the generated sounds will be different in every place through a GPS-based seeding generator. In order to use the app, first type in a name for your sound file. Next, choose between FM and AM synthesis. You can press and hold "Play Sound On Hold" for short sounds, or toggle "Permanent Sound" for continuous sound generation. Tilt the device to manipulate the different sonic parameters and to create new sounds. When you're ready to record, press the "Record" button, and "Stop" when you're finished recording to upload the sound to the server. You can listen to your previous recordings on the Saved Recording screen, or you can visit http://www.austinpetrie.com/enviromod/ to listen to every recording created on the app.

<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>
Frequency and amplitude modulation are synthesis techniques which use a modulating oscillator (sine wave) to periodically alter another oscillator, resulting in complex and spectrally rich waveforms. The timbre (or tone quality) of the carrier frequency (shown below in black) is altered by modulating either its frequency (FM) or its amplitude (AM) using a modulating signal. The rate of modulation is controlled by the modulating frequency, and the intensity of modulation is controlled by the modulation depth. In EnviroMod, the carrier frequency is controlled by the accelerometer's X-axis, the modulator frequency is controlled by the Y-axis, and the modulator depth is controlled by the Z-axis. The visiual representation below shows the basic principles used to generate sound in EnviroMod.
