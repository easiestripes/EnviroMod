This Android app allows the user to generate tones using amplitude and frequency modulation with accelerometer data.

Using location services, the tone color of the generated sounds will be different in every place through a GPS-based seeding generator.

By turning the tablet around in various positions, the user can create interesting and rich sounds with the push of a button.

Users can also record and upload their recordings to a server and listen to previous recordings.
